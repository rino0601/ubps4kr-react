THE DAY of discharge YEAH!

# 1st week
## January 6th, 2017: 1st day after discharge.
- collected lots of tutorials & guides as many as possible.

## January 7th, 2017: 2nd day after discharge.
- finished react.js part 1&2 class.
- found [this tutorial series](http://ccoenraets.github.io/es6-tutorial-data/).

## January 8th, 2017: 3rd day after discharge.
- finished to read tutorial found yesterday.
- create [ubps4kr-react repository](https://github.com/rino0601/ubps4kr-react)
- At this time, I thought I'm ready to make React.js project.
- started writing jounal.
   - At the first time, I want to write the journals on Github-pages. But It is too hard, Even more than working on the main project.

   - So I changed my mind to use Github-wiki. However, It has the poor feature to actually use.

   - Finally, Instead of all options above, I decided to use '/docs directory on master branch'. 
- no milestone has been set, yet.
- added react.js, babel, webpack, material-ui to 'stack' list in my mind
  - react.js: Of course, As a front-end framework.
  - babel: required by react.js, It called JavaScript Transpilers a.k.a JS Compiler.
  - webpack: required by react.js, It called Module bundler.
  - material-ui: As a CSS theme... I really don't want to dirty my hands for CSS works.


## January 9th, 2017: 4th day after discharge.
- Started work at 12:47.
- read [kriasoft/react-starter-kit repo](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit)carefully.
  - This project isn't for a beginner. But has lots of referenced tutorials and guides.
  - At the first time, I glanced that project. I was frustrated because there were so many technics that I'd never seen. It seems I'll never understand all of those technics.
  - but somehow, I virtually started Isomorphic app development as zero bases. Therefore, I don't have to lose anything even if I waste my time to read and understand those technics. hmm, that make sense. keep streak for it.

- read [reduxJs official document](http://redux.js.org/) to understand Flux patterns and redux library.
