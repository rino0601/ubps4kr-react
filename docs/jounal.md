- finished react.js part 1&2 class.
- found [this tutorial series](http://ccoenraets.github.io/es6-tutorial-data/).

## January 8th, 2017: 3rd day after discharge.
- finished to read tutorial found yesterday.
- create [ubps4kr-react repository](https://github.com/rino0601/ubps4kr-react)
- At this time, I thought I'm ready to make React.js project.
- started writing jounal.
   - At the first time, I want to write the journals on Github-pages. But It is too hard, Even more than working on the main project.

   - So I changed my mind to use Github-wiki. However, It has the poor feature to actually use.

   - Finally, Instead of all options above, I decided to use '/docs directory on master branch'. 
- no milestone has been set, yet.
- added react.js, babel, webpack, material-ui to 'stack' list in my mind
  - react.js: Of course, As a front-end framework.
  - babel: required by react.js, It called JavaScript Transpilers a.k.a JS Compiler.
  - webpack: required by react.js, It called Module bundler.
  - material-ui: As a CSS theme... I really don't want to dirty my hands for CSS works.
